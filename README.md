# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This project was by far the most difficult until now. I had to look up:
- how to use the REGEX function,
- how to capitalize only the first letter.

Besides these 2 obstacles I had no problems. What I am a bit proud of is that I actually used the && and || in one condition without problems. And that I understood the for loop instantly and how to work with it.

One big time-eradicator for me was the initial confusion with the '=' operator in my game(). Note to self:
!Always make sure to check the type of operators I am using before giving up!
